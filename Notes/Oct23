Coordinate Systems:

Cartesian Coordinate System: |__ XY plane with origin at (0,0)

Vector: A displacement that has direction and length. Vector not fixed in space--sometimes drawn starting from origin
    Point p + 2v = new point

    Horizontal Vector i
    Vertical Vector   j
    Ex: 2i = 3j
    Length of Vector is hypotenuse of right triangle , c^2 = a^2 + b ^2
    
Pythag proof: Using textbook visual: (a+b)^2 = c^2 + 4(1/2ab) = a^2 +2ab + b^2 = c^2 + 2ab = a^2 + b^2 = c^2 

Law of Cosines: In a triangle with sides a, b, and c, let the angle Y be opposite the side c. 
Then we have c2 = a2 + b2 âˆ’ 2ab cos Y.

HW: Given 3 points A,B,C in a plain use the law of cosines to calculate gamma
