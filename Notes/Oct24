Graphics Code Design:
    Keep Main simple
    GUI class
    Canvas--includes paintComponent method
    Canvas class calls other classes ex: Squares calls it's own draw method on g2d context
    

JFrame hold Canvas and GUI--declared in main--can use flow layout

GUI class declares/instantiates JSliders/buttons/text field/labels etc.  Stick buttons etc into own panels to control sizes


Shape Interface:
    Useful Methods: Intersect, getBounds, Contains, pathIterator
    Implementing Classes: Area, Polygon, Rectangle, Path2D--build own shape
    
Color assignment: Three overlapping circles--one red, one blue, one green. Shades of colors are controlled by sliders. 
    7 Different regions-use area class to construct intersections. 
    
    
Vector Algebra:
    Vector addition--add two displacements subsequently 
    vector subtraction: V-W = V + +(-W)
    
    DotProduct: Angle between  V.W = if theta is the angle between two vectors, V and W then the dot product is the quantity
                       length V * Length W cos theta
                       In 3d dotproduct can be generalized to x1y1z1
                       
    Normalize Vector: Unit length = Vector V/length of V
    
    Point along a line: (x1,y1) (x2,y2), Vector V = (x2-x1, y2-y1) 0 
        Midpoint x = p0 + 1/2V(x1+x2/2, y1+y2/2)
        Any point = p0 + lambda(p1-P0) ~ (1-lambda)p0 + lambda * p1 == affine combo
    
    Cross Product: new vector that is perpendicular to other two vectors. Use right hand rule 
        Vectors i, j, k: i x j =  k
                         j x i = -k
                         j x k =  i
                         k x j = -i
                         k x i =  j
                         i x k = -j
                         ixi or jxj or KxK = 0
        Intuitive method: determinate of matrix
